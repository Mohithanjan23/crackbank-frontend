🏦 Crack Bank - Cybernetic Breach Analysis Protocol
Crack Bank is a full-stack web and mobile application designed to simulate the process of checking for data breaches related to financial details. It features a "hacker terminal" aesthetic and leverages Google's Gemini AI to provide users with a security briefing and actionable advice if a breach is detected in its simulated database.

🌟 Key Features
Simulated Breach Check: Users can enter a banking detail (card number, IBAN, etc.) to check against a mock database of known data leaks.

AI-Powered Security Briefing: If a breach is found, the application uses the Gemini API to generate a clear, actionable security summary and remediation steps.

Optional Email Alerts: Users can provide an email address to receive a simulated security notification.

Cross-Platform: Available as both a responsive web application and a native mobile app for iOS and Android.

Immersive UI: A "hacker terminal" theme with typing effects and a matrix-style background to create an engaging user experience.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Node.js and npm (or yarn)

A Google API Key with the "Generative Language API" enabled.

Expo Go app on your mobile device (for running the mobile app).

1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Mohithanjan23/crackbank-backend.git](https://github.com/Mohithanjan23/crackbank-backend.git)
cd crackbank-backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file in the root directory
# and add your Google API key
echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"' > .env

# Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

2. Web Frontend Setup (React)
# Clone the repository in a new terminal window
git clone [https://github.com/Mohithanjan23/crackbank-frontend.git](https://github.com/Mohithanjan23/crackbank-frontend.git)
cd crackbank-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

The React web application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.

3. Mobile App Setup (React Native with Expo)
# Initialize a new Expo project
npx create-expo-app crackbank-mobile
cd crackbank-mobile

# Replace the default App.js and package.json with the
# mobile-specific versions provided in the project documentation.

# Install dependencies
npm install

# IMPORTANT: Open App.js and update the API_BASE_URL
# to point to your local machine's IP address
# e.g., '[http://192.168.1.10:8000/api](http://192.168.1.10:8000/api)'

# Start the development server
npx expo start

Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone to run the mobile application.

🚨 Security Disclaimer
Do NOT use your real financial information in this application. All data breach checks are simulated and performed against a dummy breaches.json file.

Protect Your API Key. The .env file containing your GOOGLE_API_KEY should never be committed to version control. Ensure it is added to your .gitignore file.
